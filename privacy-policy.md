## 1. Overview
This extension respects and protects user privacy. We will not collect, sell, or share user data except for the minimum necessary to implement the extension's core functions.

## 2. What Data We Collect
**We do not collect, excessively store, or transmit any personally identifiable data to the developer's servers.**

This extension may use the following locally (in the user's browser):
- **Local settings and preferences:** For example, toggle options, user-defined configurations, and authorized site lists (if any).
- **Necessary cache:** Used to improve performance or avoid redundant calculations (if any).

The above data is only stored locally in the user's browser (e.g., using the browser's local storage capabilities) and will not be automatically uploaded.

## 3. How We Use Data
Local settings/cache are only used to:
- Remember user preferences;
- Ensure the extension functions correctly and improve the user experience;
- Execute extension functions when explicitly triggered by the user.

## 4. Data Sharing and Sale
We **do not sell** user data.
We **do not share** user data with third parties (unless required by law or regulation).

## 5. Permissions
The permissions requested by this extension are only used to implement user-visible functions and adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## 6. Remote Code and Security
This extension does not load or execute remotely hosted executable code (e.g., remote JS/Wasm). The extension may retrieve data via HTTPS requests (such as configuration/API responses), but will not remotely download and execute code logic.

## 7. Children's Privacy
This extension is not intended for children under 13 years of age and will not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 8. Policy Updates
We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly. ## 9. Contact Us
